# Lubbock Unemployment Forecasting Project

This project was completed for my Economic & Business Forecasting class. It focuses on analyzing and forecasting the monthly unemployment rate in Lubbock County, Texas, using real-world time series data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) system.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

- **Topic:** Unemployment Rate (Lubbock County, TX)
- **Data Source:** FRED (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis)
- **Time Span:** January 1990 â€“ March 2025
- **Tools Used:** R, RMarkdown, forecast package, tseries package
- **Methods:**  
  - Data preparation and visualization  
  - Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity  
  - ARIMA and seasonal ARIMA modeling  
  - Model diagnostics and residual checks  
  - One-step ahead forecast generation  
  - Naive benchmark comparison  
  - Diebold-Mariano test for predictive ability comparison

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Takeaways

- Advanced ARIMA-based models can improve forecast accuracy over simple benchmarks, especially when capturing trend and seasonal effects.
- Even so, naive forecasts can sometimes perform comparably over short test periods, as formal tests like Diebold-Mariano may show.
- Time series forecasting requires careful balance between model complexity and generalizability.
